# Singleton
The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. The pattern ensures that the class can only be instantiated once, and any subsequent attempts to instantiate it will return the same instance.

## Intent
The intent of the Singleton design pattern is to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global access point to it. This can be useful in situations where you only want a single instance of a class to be created, and all references to that instance should point to the same object.

## Problem
Suppose you have a class that is resource-intensive or expensive to create, such as a database connection or a network socket. You may only want one instance of this class to be created, as creating multiple instances would be wasteful or even harmful. However, if you simply create a global variable to hold the instance, you will have no control over when the instance is created, and it may be created unnecessarily.

## Solution
The Singleton design pattern solves this problem by ensuring that the class can only be instantiated once and by providing a global access point to the instance. This is achieved by defining a special method that is responsible for creating the instance and ensuring that it is only called once. The instance is then stored in a private static variable, and the special method is made public and static so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

By using the Singleton design pattern, you can ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to it, while still maintaining control over when the instance is created.

## Participants
- **Singleton**: Defines the special method that is responsible for creating the instance and ensuring that it is only called once. The instance is stored in a private static variable, and the special method is made public and static so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

## Related Design Patterns
The Singleton design pattern is often used in conjunction with the ***Factory Method*** pattern, as the Factory Method can be used to create the singleton instance.
The ***Prototype*** pattern can also be used to create a single instance of a class, although it does so by cloning an existing instance rather than creating a new one.
