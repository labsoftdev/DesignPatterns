# Design Patterns
Welcome to the Design Patterns repository! Here, you will find examples and explanations of various design patterns in object-oriented programming.

## What are design patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They can help improve the flexibility and maintainability of your code by providing proven approaches for solving recurring problems.

## Categories of Design Patterns
Design patterns can be broadly classified into the following categories:

**Creational patterns**: These design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

**Structural patterns**: These design patterns focus on object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

**Behavioral patterns**: These design patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together.

Each category serves a different purpose and addresses a different set of problems. Understanding these categories can help you choose the right design pattern for your specific needs.
